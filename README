This is a cost tracker with the following features (Pre-release version):
 - Excel-like table to add the costs 
 - Calculates the daily, monthly and yearly costs
 - Multi-user option (Local only, and thus cannot be used concurrently with other users).
 - Password (If you do not want anyone accessing your costs)
 - CSV file/s that will be updated when you add/edit your costs

Initial pre-release - Version 0.07:
 - Initial file creation. I'm still learning Python programming and should have uploaded to Github earlier for version control but this should suffice.
 - Note, this is still not yet complete hence pre-release. I'll complete it I have all the planned features sorted out.

Version 0.08
 - Refactored several lines. Further clean up and moving functions. Removed redundant functions. Done my consistency check and ensured all CSV/JSON/FILENAME are directed towards to Common.py.
 - Modified several existing functions.

Version 0.09:
 - Updated CostCell & CSVManagement.py to fix the errors around loading CSV, to allow CSV to be read, and to allow data to write to CSV

Pending features to add prior to release:
 - Adding load previous month button
 - Add in SUM automatic calculation feature on the bottom or on the side to calculate daily, weekly, monthly and yearly costs
 - Add in a button to add the target cost to allow the user for tracking purposes

Current issues:
 - Files not saving where the user desires them to.
 - 2 different empty folders being created when it should be 1 folder where user desires to save the files to
 - 3 different csvs being created. It should be for 1 CSV. 
 - I've got the CSV to write the days on the row, but the first column does not have the header labels written.

** Solved Issues
 - 1 CSV saving inside the folder and are not being used 
 - JSON and CSV are saving and are being loaded outside of the main python folder
 - Not loading properly.
